# GameDev_Diary:


### New Knowledge Learned:

- The usage of created functions
- New things about object-oriented programming
- Being comfortable about collision detection between different types of objects

### Old Knowledge Dusted Off:

- The usage of variables
- If statements

### Easiest / Most Fun:

- Seeing the different objects interact
- Building off of the pseudo code

### Where I Struggled:

- Creating the proper if then statements to provide accruate collision methods
- Making sure that I was coding in the most efficient way so that my window was not lagging when I ran it
- THE NEW VELOCITY METHOD! (I hope to go back and figure this out lol it was not working for me)
