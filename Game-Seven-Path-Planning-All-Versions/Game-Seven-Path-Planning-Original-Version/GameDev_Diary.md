# Game Dev Diary

##### New Knowledge I have learned:

    - More about finite-state-machines

    - About path planning and A*

    - How to use Git (WOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO)

##### Old Knowledge I Dusted Off:

    - Object-oriented programming

##### What Was the Easiest / Most Fun:

    - Envolking diagnals

    - Envolking manhattan distance

    - Playing with burgers

##### Where Did I Struggle:

    I stuggled a little on making this into a game as there are some bugs concering the burgers and them disapearing. I want to revisit this assignment this week to put sprites over the burgers and get rid of the bugs!
