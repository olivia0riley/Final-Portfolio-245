# Post Mortem:


### What Went Well:

    After completing this game, I felt that overlal the outcome was good. I enoyed working with my group members and communicating with them over Slack and in person. I think what really helped was that we came together to figure out GitHub, which helps us all in the long run. In terms of things that went poorly, I really do not think there are many things that went "wrong" per say.

### Things I Would Change if I Were to Restart:

    If I were to restart, on my own, this game would look a lot different. There are little things I would have done differently like using free sprites offline instead of drawing them or simplifying some of the code, but one of the biggest things for me would be that I would have focused on making a much simpler version of the game.

### How We Worked as a Group / What I was Responsible For:

    Throughout the course of the making of this game, sometimes I felt I was not contributing enough towards the final outcome. I worked on specific categories such as roomba behaviors and initialiing them and figuring out how we were gonna distinguish them from one another, but my code somtimes proved too rudimentory and was swapped out for my partners' more experienced code. In addition, sometimes I felt I just was not on the same level of caliper as them and could not keep up with the code they were writing. However, throughout the course of this term I have always been uncomfortable with feeling behind in my knowledge but I learned so much from this project BECAUSE my partners were able to teach me new things I did not know before, which is huge to take away. I got more comfortable with asking them questions and having them help me with my code which is also great.

### If I Were to Continue With the Project:

    If I were to continue with the project, I would like to add more color and get rid of some of the code we are no longer using. I would also like to add more animation frames when the character is walking so it is more seamless (I recognize this is very hard and time conssuming).

### What I Learned from this Project and From this Course:

    Starting with what I learned from this project, one of the huge things I learned was how the usage of variables as much as possible is super helpful as well as multiple modules. I also learned that sometimes complicated code is worse than simple code because it is important that the reader can understand what is going on. I also learned that it is okay to feel like your partner may know more than you or has more experience, that is the whole point! To be able to learn from them and read code that is truly awesome makes me happy and hopeful that I will feel that confident in the future. However, in terms of this class, I have learned so much about code, but so much about myself. I have learned about object-oriented programming, sprites, collisions, and all that stuff but I have also learned that every class is what I make of it. I was very uncomfortable in the beggining of the class this term, however I came to realize everyone just wants to help one another and to see each other grow. No matter the difference in my code from my partners' or anyone else, it is all in the process of learning that it becomes important.

### Side Notes I Feel I must Mention:

    MASSIVE shoutout to Nolan. He helped me so much during this project and literally was there to help me at the drop of a hat. He always had amazing spirits and just the biggest smile on his face, genuinley excited to create something awesome. He truly inspired me during this time that I can do whatever I want to. Also even bigger shoutout to you (Professor Rieffel) for literally helping me all term. You are amazing and are an awesome support system for any CS student and that meant the world to me this term. Thanks for putting up with my yourmom jokes and many others while also ensuring that all of your students can succeed in this course realisitcally. You're awesome!

P.S. This is a lot to read and I'm sorry I just had a lot of realizations and thank yous!

PEACE OUT 245
