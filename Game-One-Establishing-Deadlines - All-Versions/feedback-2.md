nice!

## HW2 - guessing game

nice!

## Night Sky

A good first start but there are a couple of red flags for me here, mostly having to do with the amount of copy/paste coding that's going on here.  Copy/Paste is really inelegant, is inextensible, and is an easy way to introduce errors into your programs.

For your portfolio, replace the repeated lines of code with something cleaner, ideally an object oriented implementation with clean `for` loops. 

## Overall Feedback

A good start, with some well identified growth areas!
