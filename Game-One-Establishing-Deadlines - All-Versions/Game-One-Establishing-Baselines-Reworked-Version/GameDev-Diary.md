# GameDev Diary:

#### Corrections:

- Having read the feedback, what I did was use a loop to initialize the star coordinates and radii instead of initializing them all separately
- To draw the "stars" I used another loop to iterate throught the big_lst in order to use the elements to draw each individual star


##### My Thoughts on the Corrections Made:

    The corrections make the code look a lot cleaner and make sure less error occurs from me typing so much. Overall, very happy with the corrections!
