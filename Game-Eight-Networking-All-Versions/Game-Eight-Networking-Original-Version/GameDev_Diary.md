# GameDev Diary:

# New Knowledge Learned:

- Sending and receiving messages between servers and clients
- Ports and how to use them in terms of networking

##### Old Knowledge Dusted Off:

- Usage of variables
- Usage of object oriented programming
- Loops/ if satements

##### What was the easiest/ most fun:

- Implementation of "hit" and sending messages back and forth from server to client
- Code was easy to play around with after understanding it

##### What was the most difficult:

- For me, the most difficult was the blinking of the players scores as well as the implementation of the sound. I hope to go back and rework it so I can make those elements work.
