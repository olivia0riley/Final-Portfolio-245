# GameDev Diary (Corrections):

### Corrections Made:

    I corrected my original version by making the popping sound work everytime the player clicks the balloon and making sure player names are displayed on the screen.


### Thoughts on Corrections:

    Overall, I feel the corrections make the game a lot better and work to its advantage. While it was difficult for the displaying of a name, I figured it out in the end and thats all I can ask for.
