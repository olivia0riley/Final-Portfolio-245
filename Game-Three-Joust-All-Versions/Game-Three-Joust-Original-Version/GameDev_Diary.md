# GameDev Diary


### New Knowledge Learned:

- How to use sprites / use an updating sprite list for animation
- How to implement moving methods for sprites and make use of updating the display
- Collision methods

### Old Knowledge Dusted Off:

- The usage of lists and loops
- Usage of general variables
- Parts of object-oriented programming

### Easiest / Most Fun:

- Seeing the charater come to life
- Making use of the psuedo code and using it as an outline for multiple implementations

### Struggles:

- Struggles came mostly from the jump method and debugging it when the player jumps over platforms
- Definitley flipping the sprite
- I hope to debug this before the term ends cause I think it could be very cool.
