# GameDev Diary:

### Old Knowledge Dusted Off:

    While I did not make any "Corrections" I did add some fun stuff like a background and sound when the player jumps

#### My Thoughts on Corrections Made:

    This just makes the game so much more fun and interactive and I love it. So so enthused by these new aditions!!!
