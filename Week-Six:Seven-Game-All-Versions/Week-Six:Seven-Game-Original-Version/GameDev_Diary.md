# Game Dev Diary

##### New Knowledge Learned:

- What finite-state-machines are and their purpose.
- How to use finite-state-machines

##### Old Knowledge Dusted Off:

- Usage of variables
- Usage of object oriented programming
- Concepts Learned during collisions


##### What was the easiest/ most fun:

- Implementation of wander/ freeze
- Learning about finite-state-machines

##### What was the most difficult:

- For me, the most difficult was getting the states to work properly and also getting there to be multiple birds (for some reason this implementation did not work). I hope to submit this for feedback and redo some stuff with a bit of adivce to finish up this project.
