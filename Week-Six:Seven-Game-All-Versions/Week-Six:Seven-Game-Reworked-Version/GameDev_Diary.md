# Game Dev Diary (Corrections)


### Corrections Made:

    In terms of corrections, I made sure to make sure I was able to introduce more than one movingball into the picture which was a nice addition. I also played around with random coloring just for fun to see what would happen.


### My thoughts on Corrections:

    While I am happy with the corrections I made, I am sad that I was unable to add more states. For some reason no matter what I did, things would be wonky and mess up my other transitions. Oh well, I am happy with what I was able to do notheless!
