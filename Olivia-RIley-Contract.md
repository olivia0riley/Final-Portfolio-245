#### What Grade I think I Should Get:

    In thinking about the grade I deserve, I think to what I have accomplished in this course. I have handed in my in-class assignments, all of my games (some with incomplete objectives as I couldn't figure them out), submitted notes throughout the term, attended most of the CS drop in hours, asked questions in Slack, sent some memes for fun because why not, corrected most of my games made throughout the term and worked with an awesome group to create a project that demonstrates many concepts of the class. While I did a lot during this course, I think theres stuff I could have done better. These things include, handing things in on time, communicated more with my professor, and also submitted more of my notes throughout the term. In thinking of my KWLs, I also hit all of them pretty well, having learned the things I was confused about in the begginging of the course. However, I still have a long way to go when it comes to object-oriented programming. Thinking of my short-commings and everything I accomplished I think I deserve an A- or a B+ because I did almost everything I intended to do within my contract and really put the work in to accomplish that. This class was not easy for me, but it was so so fun and I had a great time. I am very much happy with what I will take away from this class and apply to others!
