# GameDev Diary (For Corrections):


### Corrections Made:

    I made corrections to the old GameDev Diary making sure it wasn't too vague and also changed the file name to be liked by the computer. I also added little things like a backdrop, water drop sounds, and where the objects initiate to simulate the idea of bats in a cave for more fun and jazz!


### My Thoughts on Corrections:

    Overall I feel what I was working with originally was pretty good but I just wanted to have fun with it and make it into something different which I did with the idea of bats in a cave.
