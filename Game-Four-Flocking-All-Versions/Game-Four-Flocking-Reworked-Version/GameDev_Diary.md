# GameDev Diary

### New Knowledge Learned:

- How to make use of vectors in code
- Object-oriented programing
- Usage of sound and backgrounds

### Old Knowledge Dusted Off:

- The usage of lists and loops
- Usage of general variables
- Parts of object-oriented programming

### Easiest / Most Fun:

- Seeing my work paying off by the drawing of the vectors
- Making use of the psuedo code and using it as an outline for multiple implementations

### Struggles:

- Struggles came mostly from the implementations of each method and the little changes between each one
- Making use of the correct variables
- Figuring out the cohesion method
