### Game Dev Diary:


* New knowdlege included transfering code for one object to code for as many objects using lists and loops
* Old knowledge included using object-oriented programming in terms of making many objects and having knowledge about their inputs
* The easiest/ most fun part of the project was making little amounts of progress and just slowly learning how things work
* I struggled on the last methods such as separation
